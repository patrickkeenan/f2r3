## Figma > UIKit

# How to

- Go to the [import page](/import)
- Authenticate your figma account
- Copy a frame link - select a layer in figma and press command + L
- Paste it into the text field and press import
- You'll see your layout here, as well as the JSON and TSX
- To sign out go to [/signout](/signout)

# Finishing

- Make landing page that explains what this is with links to UIKit, Codesandbox, Figma, the layout of this page, a youtube intro, etc
- Make default import page with UI that explains how to use it
- Turn the URL into a pill with a title if its valid
- Make sure it all works in Headset, add a headset link that adds the token hmd.link/url

# Todo

- Support properties
  - Strokes
  - horizontalPadding/verticalPadding
  - counterAxisSpacing,
  - layoutPositioning
  - itemReverseZIndex,
- Support types
  - VECTOR
- Derrive z depth from invisible dropshadow Y property
- Add some kind of flow support
- Figure out COMPONENT, INSTANCE
  - Add hover/press actions

# Lower priority

- Hyperlink
- Add wrapping support
- Add grid support
- Support shapes: STAR, LINE, ELLIPSE, REGULAR_POLYGON, RECTANGLE

# Don't think these will work

- overflowDirection
- effects
- maskType
- BlendMode
- BOOLEAN_OPERATION

# Future thoughts

- Could you maintain a UIKit "kit" in figma and export components?
- Could you make a symbol library for the existing "kits" and map those layers to proper components?

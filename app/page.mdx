## Figma > UIKit

# How to

- Go to the [import page](/import)
- Authenticate your figma account
- Copy a frame link - select a layer in figma and press command + L
- Paste it into the text field and press import
- You'll see your layout here, as well as the JSON and TSX
- To sign out go to [/signout](/signout)

# Tips

- Limit layers in the file, the importer imports the whole file
- Round corners (images do not get their corners cropped)
- Rasterize images
- To use variants, all states must be in the file you're exporting
- Use an invisible drop shadow, the Y offset will become the z offset
- Layer rotation is not supported

# Finishing

Todo

- Make landing page that explains what this is with links to UIKit, Codesandbox, Figma, the layout of this page, a youtube intro, etc
- Make default import page with UI that explains how to use it
- Turn the URL into a pill with a title if its valid
- Make sure it all works in Headset, add a headset link that adds the token hmd.link/url
- Add loading text to spinner to explain what its doing

# Todo

# Must fix

- Add animation to interaction changes
- XR
  - Set camera and pixel size to match

# Lower priority

- Interaction
  - Add focus as a state to watch for
- Control
  - Allow layer positioning, figure out a way to have multiple UIs at different locations
  - Allow locking: lock=hand, lock=head
- Support properties
  - rotation of layers
  - absolute layoutPositioning in auto layout layers
- Support types
  - VECTOR
- Hyperlink
- Add wrapping support
- Add grid support
- Support shapes: STAR, LINE, ELLIPSE, REGULAR_POLYGON, RECTANGLE

# Don't think these will work

- overflowDirection
- effects
- maskType
- BlendMode
- BOOLEAN_OPERATION
- INNER_SHADOW
- DROP_SHADOW
- LAYER_BLUR
- BACKGROUND_BLUR

# Future thoughts

- Could you maintain a UIKit "kit" in figma and export components?
- Could you make a symbol library for the existing "kits" and map those layers to proper components?
